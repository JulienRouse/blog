      <description>First contribution to another project on Github ever! :)
It was very small, the library was a very small and new library that wanted to groups lots of functionalities pertaining to strings for Common Lisp. The creator/maintener asked for help on the lisp subreddit and I gave it a try. It was a good way to get my feet wet, a very small project with a responsive maintener that took the time to explains things to me on how to contribute on Github and such.</description>
