# About my custom keyboard layout

Since June 2019 I use an Ergodox keyboard (black and non printed). I spend a bit of time changing my layout to accomodate my usage.

In this post I'll share my thought process about the layout I crafted, what I learned doing so and how I see it evolve in the near futur.

If your not familiar with reprogrammable keyboard, layer, and dual-keys you might want to go look on the [ergodox-ez website](https://ergodox-ez.com/#opensource).

## My layout

You can find my [layout here](https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/ergodox-ez/layouts/YErj4/latest/0) to follow along. The website Ergodox-ez is really well made to visualize and modify the layout, it can also be used to view layout others have devised. 

### Qwerty vs Azerty vs Bepo vs Colemak vs Dvorak

I went with Qwerty because I'm familiar with it and my laptop is also Qwerty so it's easier to switch to it. But Azerty would have been totally fine too in most cases because in France we are used to our french-flavored azerty.

I looked at Bepo, Colemak and Dvorak but there was one major pain point: shortcuts.  When switching to those layout you pretty much have to remap every software you use to reflect the layout and that's something I was not inclined to do. (Especially not for Emacs, which has already a very tough learning curve, I wanted to be able to follow guide and tutorials if needed without that complexity added).

Without that, I think Colemak or Dvorak would have been fine. Bepo a bit less because, even so having french letters easily accessible is really nice, I believe I type french less than 50% of the time so it's probably more important to have a keyboard that help me type english (and code) more efficiently.

### French  symbols

While I said I type french less than 50% of the time, I still need to access easily to french symbol (like é, è, ê, ç, à, ù, ë...) so I use a layout dedicated to those. I put the à, é, ù respectively on top of a, e, u for more ease.

For the circonflex and the trema, I use a diacritic. I type ^ then e and it gives me ê. It's ok, if I could have ê directly that might be nice but it's not terribly inefficient.

What I miss the most is capitalized and accentued letter in one touch (something that Bepo, and now the new Azerty is providing!) . I need to introduce more diacritic to combine accent with capitalized letters.

### Symbols (or programmation symbols)
